Given a tweet. Strign tweet
Break it into dependencies
Extract subjects and objects
	Of those, tag the nounds, verbs, adjectives and adverbs
	Pass them to Analysis with their tags
	Run combinations of analysis till we find x many categories for it
	(Some words will be tagged wrong! Might need to search word net or a dictionary for a better tag)


If wordnet can't find wordd, then use DBPedia?
