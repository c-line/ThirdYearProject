\section{Motivation}
A new technology, still in it's infancy, is being developed to gather meaning behind data on the internet. This technology is called the Semantic Web. Currently, one of the biggest projects involved in the Semantic Web is DBPedia, an ontology of the entirity of Wikipedia. By exctracting meaning from such large data sets, a computer can tell you what an article is talking about without it explicitly being told. 
%Give this a little more explanation
Another popular research area is sentiment analysis of social media such as Twitter. The aim of which is to understand what users of the social media are talking about at a point in time, or feelings towards a specific topic, and then exploiting that knowledge for individual purposes.
These technologies are advancements in artificial intelligence in computing, and they can be further developed to optimise the information we can gain from this data and how it is used. 

\section{Project Aims}
The aim of this project is to develop software that can take available data from Twitter and produce a visualisation that displays relevant topics talked about on Twitter and for each user what that topic means to them. The outcome of this project is a unique representation of Twitter users.
This sentiment anlysis aims to dynamically understand what is being talked about on Twitter and to who it is meaningful.
